# Part 2 - Training and Testing Data Writeup

After completing `a6_part2.py` answer the following questions

## Questions to answer

1. What makes this model more effective than the model you created in the previous lesson?
This model is more effective tan the model we created in the previous lesson because the testing and training data is split randomly.

2. What does the R squared coefficient tell you about the model?
The R-squared coefficient tells me that the model is slightly less correlated than the previous model.

3. Would you say that your model is accurate? What evidence supports your conclusion? Consider the meaning of the predicted and actual values in the context of the chart below from the American Heart Associationâ€™s website on understanding blood pressure.
I would say that the model is not as accurate, as there is more variation in the potential R-squared coefficient value. Although the training and testing data is split randomly, it may still not be more accurate. However, according to the chart from the American Heart Association, the readings are generally higher than average.
