# Part 3 - Multivariable Linear Regression Writeup

After completing `a6_part3.py` answer the following questions

## Questions to answer

1. What is the R Squared coefficient for your model? What does that mean about the model in relation to your data?
My R squared coefficient is 0.86. This means that the model has a heavy relation to the data, as it is close to 1.

2. Is your model accurate? Why or why not?
Yes, this model is accurate because the predicted values are within a relatively small amount of money to the true value.

3. What does the model predict a 10-year-old car with 89000 miles is worth? What about a car that is 20 years old with 150000 miles?
For the 10 year old car, it predicts that it will be 9135.173. For the 20 year old car, it predicts that it will be 2304.262

4. You may notice that some of your predicted results are negative. This is occurring when the value of age and the mileage of the car are very high. Why do you think this is happening?

This might happen due to a potentially negative trendline. The price of the car may continue to decrease until it crosses the x-axis.
