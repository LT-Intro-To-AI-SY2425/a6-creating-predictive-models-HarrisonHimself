## Questions to answer

High Income High Spenders: Ballers
High Income Low Spenders: Investers
Low Income High Spenders: People who don't care about generational wealth, and don't want to retire.
Low Income Low Spending: Average Millenial

2. What group would a customer who has a medium income and low spending habits be in?
I would group them with the high income, low spending invester category.

3. Choose one cluster of interest to you. How might the marketing team approach this specific customer group?
A cluster of interest to me are the High Income, Low spenders. A marketing team might find a way to pack high value into their product, so frugal people who only buy nessecities and value saving money will have a reason to buy their product.
